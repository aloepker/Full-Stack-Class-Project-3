Building off Project 2:

• Remove/disable all JavaScript/HTML5 Form Validation, from Project 2.
  You can do this by removing any <script> tags and adding <form>
   attribute novalidate.

• Add server side PHP form validation for user input.
  PHP will not be doing any of the phone/zip formatting.
    Leave that to the JavaScript side of things.
      Since we are disabling the JavaScript for this project,
       it is ok to make the user type out the phone/zip format
        explicitly so that PHP will accept formatted input.

• Use PHP to do all the same form validation that
   JavaScript was doing on the client side.

o If PHP detects invalid form data, return to Registration page
with messaging on each form field that failed. Make sure to have all
 valid and invalid user data populated on the
screen so the user does not have to remember what was typed.

o Upon successful PHP form validation, submit valid data to the
 Registration Confirmation page and display a confirmation page.
  This confirmation page will be read only, so the
user cannot modify the data on this screen.
